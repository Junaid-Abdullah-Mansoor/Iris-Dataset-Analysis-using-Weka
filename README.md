# Iris Dataset Analysis using Weka

This project focuses on analyzing the famous Iris dataset using the Weka tool. The Iris dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in machine learning and contains measurements of various attributes of different Iris flower species. In this project, we aim to evaluate different algorithms for decision tree classification and Bayesian learning. Additionally, clustering algorithms will be tested on the same dataset.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of measurements for four attributes of Iris flowers:

1. **Sepal length**
2. **Sepal width**
3. **Petal length**
4. **Petal width**

These attributes are used to classify the Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. The dataset is widely used for classification and pattern recognition tasks.

## Analysis Algorithms
In this project, we employ the Weka tool to evaluate the performance of different algorithms for decision tree classification, Bayesian learning, and clustering on the Iris dataset. The specific algorithms used are as follows:

**Decision Tree Classification**
- DecisionTree: A decision tree algorithm that creates a tree-like model for classification based on the attribute values.

**Bayesian Learning**
- NaiveBayes: A probabilistic classifier that applies Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features.
- BayesNet: A Bayesian network algorithm that models the relationships between attributes as a directed acyclic graph.

**Clustering**
- K-Means: A clustering algorithm that partitions the dataset into K clusters based on the similarity of data points.
- Expectation-Maximization (EM): A clustering algorithm that estimates the parameters of a statistical model using the expectation-maximization framework.

## Project Analysis Steps
This project involves the following analysis steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: The Iris dataset is loaded into the Weka tool, and any preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values or normalizing data, are performed if required.
2. **Decision Tree Classification**: The decision tree algorithm is applied to classify the Iris flowers into their respective species. The accuracy and performance metrics are evaluated.
3. **Bayesian Learning**: The Naive Bayes and BayesNet algorithms are applied to perform classification on the Iris dataset. The accuracy and performance metrics of these algorithms are assessed.
4. **Clustering Analysis**: The K-Means and Expectation-Maximization algorithms are used for clustering analysis on the Iris dataset. The resulting clusters are evaluated and compared.
5. **Conclusion**: A summary of the findings, including the performance of each algorithm and insights gained from the analysis, is provided.

## Conclusion
This project aimed to analyze the Iris dataset using the Weka tool and evaluate various algorithms for decision tree classification, Bayesian learning, and clustering. By applying these algorithms, we gained insights into the classification and clustering of Iris flowers based on their attribute measurements. The performance of each algorithm and the quality of the resulting models were assessed.
